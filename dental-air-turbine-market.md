<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Air Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inside Exhaust</li><li>Outside Exhaust</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental air turbine market is segmented into two main types: inside exhaust and outside exhaust systems. Inside exhaust turbines expel air and debris directly into the oral cavity, providing efficient suction and minimizing external contamination. Outside exhaust units, on the other hand, vent air and waste away from the patient, enhancing comfort and maintaining a cleaner work environment. Both types contribute to improved clinical procedures, patient experience, and the overall effectiveness of dental treatments.</p></p>
