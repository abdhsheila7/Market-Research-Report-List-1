<p><strong>The Car Audio Crossovers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Car audio crossovers are vital components that manage the frequency range sent to speakers. The two main types are active and passive crossovers. Active crossovers utilize electronic circuits to filter audio signals before they reach the amplifier, allowing for more precise tuning and adjustment. In contrast, passive crossovers operate after the amplifier, using inductors and capacitors to redirect frequencies. Active crossovers generally provide better sound control, while passive crossovers are simpler and easier to install, each catering to different audio preferences and setups.</p></p>
